# Wikipedia "On this day" Bluesky Bot ðŸ¤–

A Bluesky bot that posts the "On this day" articles from Wikipedia on Bluesky.  
  
The bot will parse the Atom feed \(URL can be defined per [environment variables](#environment-variables)\) and beautify the HTML into nice RichText that will be posted to Bluesky. The RichText will also include custom facets as per the [Bluesky][1] and [atproto][2] documentation in order to incorporate links to the respective Wikipedia pages as present in the original "On this day" article.  
  
Per default, the bot will post one entry of the "On this day" article every other hour, but this can be configured/customized via [environment variables](#environment-variables).

An example post on Bluesky could look something like this:
